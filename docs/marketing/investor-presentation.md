# Investor Presentation

This document is a concise, investor‑ready slide deck (in markdown) that can be rendered to PDF or presented directly. It follows the 12‑slide structure we previously built for Flowwolf Autonomous.

---

## Slide 1 – Title
**Flowwolf**
*The Intent‑Native Operating System for Logistics*

- **Revenue now → Industry dominance later**
- **TAM:** $30B by 2030
- **ARR Target (2027+):** $10M
- **Autonomous Execution:** 90%+

---

## Slide 2 – Problem
**$30B Intent Gap** – Business intent is lost in rigid protocol translations (EDI, API, Email). Manual mapping teams, failed integrations, and exception handling drive massive costs.

---

## Slide 3 – Solution
**Intent‑Native OS** – Govern intent, not protocols. Any signal → Intent Graph → Autonomous Execution.

---

## Slide 4 – Paid Autonomy Ladder™
| Level | Name | Price | Autonomy % |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| L1 | Visibility | $500/mo | 10‑15% |
| L2 | Assisted | $1‑2K/mo | 25‑35% |
| L3 | Conditional | $2‑5K/mo | 50‑60% |
| L4 | Cross‑Domain | $7‑15K/mo | 70‑80% |
| L5 | Full Autonomous | $15‑50K+/mo | 90%+ |

---

## Slide 5 – Market Opportunity
$30B+ TAM (EDI, Integration Tools, RPA). 3× expansion by addressing email, voice, API signals.

---

## Slide 6 – AI‑Native Architecture
Cortex, Fluent, Motion, Saturn – OS‑grade reliability, <200 ms latency, 99.9% SLA, 100% test coverage.

---

## Slide 7 – Competitive Advantage
- **Layer:** OS vs Application
- **Input:** Intent vs Protocol
- **Safety:** Progressive vs All‑or‑Nothing

---

## Slide 8 – Go‑to‑Market Strategy
1️⃣ **Wedge** (Year 1‑2) – Mid‑market 3PLs, $500→$2K/mo.
2️⃣ **Climb** (Year 3‑5) – Enterprise shippers, $2K→$15K/mo.
3️⃣ **Platform** (Year 6‑10) – Ecosystem, subscriptions + marketplace.

## Slide 9 – Revenue Roadmap
| Version | Timeline | MRR/ARR | Milestone |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| v6.0 | Q1 2026 | $50K MRR | L1‑L2, 10 FDPs |
| v7.0 | Q2 2026 | $250K MRR | L3, 50 customers |
| v8.0 | H2 2026 | $1M ARR | L4, ecosystem |
| v9.0 | 2027+ | $10M ARR | L5, industry standard |

---

## Slide 10 – Unit Economics
**Pricing Formula**: `Platform Base + Σ(Intent × Autonomy Multiplier)`

---

## Slide 11 – Ready to Execute
Production‑ready docs, commercial model, AI‑native core, partnership program.

---

## Slide 12 – The Ask
**Seed Round:** $2M
**Runway:** 18 months to $1M ARR
**Team Allocation:** Engineering 50%, Sales 30%, Infra 15%, Ops 5%
