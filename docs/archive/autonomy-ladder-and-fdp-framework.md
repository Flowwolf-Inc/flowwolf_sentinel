# Sales‑Led Autonomy Platform Framework

**Purpose:** Build revenue fast with existing and new customers, while converging toward a trillion‑dollar, industry‑standard autonomous logistics platform.

---

## 1. Core Strategy (Executive Summary)

- Start **sales‑first**, not platform‑first
- Monetize **assisted autonomy early**
- Let autonomy mature **per intent**, not per customer
- Protect long‑term dominance by freezing the core only at maturity

**Version Path**
- v6 — Sales‑Led Autonomy (Revenue engine)
- v7 — Conditional / Partial Autonomy (Trust & proof)
- v8 — Platform Gravity (Ecosystem dominance)
- v9 — Industry Standard (Constitutional core)

---

## 2. The Paid Autonomy Ladder

Autonomy is earned and paid for progressively.

### Level 1 — Visibility Automation (10–15%)
- Observe, normalize, detect
- No system writes
- Zero operational risk

### Level 2 — Assisted Execution (25–35%)
- AI proposes, humans approve
- Reversible actions
- Direct labor savings

### Level 3 — Conditional Autonomy (50–60%)
- Auto‑execute within confidence thresholds
- Humans handle anomalies only
- Real headcount reduction

### Level 4 — Cross‑Domain Autonomy (70–80%)
- Multi‑agent optimization across finance, ops, carriers
- Policy‑driven tradeoffs
- Structural margin improvement

### Level 5 — Full Autonomous Operations (90%+)
- Humans define intent, system operates end‑to‑end
- Governance‑only intervention
- Platform becomes infrastructure

---

## 3. Technical Contract per Autonomy Tier

Each tier upgrades four contracts:

1. **Decision Authority** — who decides
2. **Execution Rights** — what can run automatically
3. **Risk & Override** — rollback, kill switch, escalation
4. **Audit & Liability** — traceability and accountability

Autonomy never increases without stronger audit guarantees.

---

## 4. Intent × Autonomy Model

- Autonomy is evaluated **per intent**, not per customer
- Each intent has its own timeline

### Example Intents
- Invoice Processing (fast path)
- Load Planning (medium path)
- Claims & Disputes (slow / capped path)

This allows:
- Faster monetization of safe intents
- Slower, trust‑based evolution of risky ones

---

## 5. Pricing Autonomy per Intent

### Pricing Formula

**Monthly Price = Platform Base + Σ(Intent Price)**

#### Platform Base
- Governance, audit, policy engine, dashboards

#### Intent Price
- Volume metric × Autonomy Multiplier

**Autonomy Multipliers**
- L1: 1.0×
- L2: 1.4×
- L3: 2.0×
- L4: 3.0×
- L5: 4.5× (enterprise only)

Optional outcome‑based pricing can be layered where ROI is provable.

---

## 6. Customer Classes & Economics

### Class A — Founding Design Partners (FDPs)

**What they get**
- Price lock (3–5 years) OR small early discount
- Faster autonomy progression
- Influence via design councils
- Exit / migration protections

**What they don’t get**
- Permanent discounts
- Custom forks

### Class B — Growth Customers
- Public pricing
- Standard autonomy timelines
- SLAs and repeatable onboarding

### Class C — Industry Standard Customers
- Highest prices
- Long‑term support guarantees
- Backward compatibility

---

## 7. Autonomy Credit System (Instead of Discounts)

Non‑monetary credits that unlock value faster:

- **Evidence Credits** — fewer samples needed to level up
- **Authority Credits** — higher auto‑execution caps
- **Velocity Credits** — priority enablement and reviews

Credits are earned through good behavior and can expire.

---

## 8. Frappe DocType Mapping (High Level)

### Global Catalog
- Intent
- Autonomy Level
- Action Catalog

### Customer Contract Layer
- Intent Autonomy Profile (key contract)
- Policy Bundle

### Runtime & Evidence
- Decision Log (append‑only)
- Autonomy Evidence Snapshot

### Commercial Layer
- Pricing Plan
- Intent Pricing Rule
- Subscription

---

## 9. Autonomy Console (Sales + Customer UI)

### Key Views
- Autonomy Score & ROI summary
- Intent × Autonomy matrix
- Per‑intent upgrade cards
- Price impact previews

### Sales Overlay
- Expansion MRR potential
- Upgrade readiness
- Blockers and risk flags

This UI becomes the expansion engine.

---

## 10. Founder Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

- Sell outcomes, not autonomy
- Autonomy matures at the speed of trust
- Never discount the future standard
- Increase decision authority only with stronger audit

---

**Result:**
A sales‑led system that monetizes early, scales safely, and converges into a dominant, industry‑standard autonomous logistics platform.
