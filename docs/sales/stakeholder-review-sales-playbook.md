# Stakeholder Review: The Sales Team (VP Sales)

**Reviewer**: Antigravity (Persona: VP Sales, Quota Crusher)  
**Date**: 2026-01-08  
**Tone**: Enthusiastic, Pragmatic, Focused on Closing.

## 1. What Sells (The Hooks)

### A. "The 2-Hour Onboarding" (Generative Agent)
*   *Feedback*: "This is the demo closer. Every competitor takes 6 weeks to set up EDI. If I can drag-and-drop a PDF in the demo and show it parsing in real-time, I win the deal right there."
*   *Request*: Can we make the `ArchitectAgent` UI look incredible? I want fancy animations while it "Thinks".

### B. "The Safety Net" (Governance)
*   *Feedback*: "Finally! I lose so many deals because the CTO is scared of AI liability. Being able to say 'You define the laws, the AI just obeys them' overcomes the #1 objection."

## 2. The Selling Friction (My Headaches)

### A. Complexity of "Intent Graph"
*   *Concern*: "Intent Graph. Federated Knowledge. Vector Resolution." -- This is too nerdy. My AEs (Account Executives) won't understand it, and neither will the Logistics Manager we sell to.
*   *Request*: Simplify the messaging. Call it "Collective Intelligence" or "Smart Network". Don't sell the architecture; sell the *outcome*.

### B. "Outcome-Based Pricing" is Hard
*   *Concern*: "You want me to sell based on '% of Efficiency'? That's a nightmare to contract. The customer wants a flat SaaS fee."
*   *Proposal*: Let's stick to "Tiered Autonomy Pricing".
    *   Tier 1 (Manual): $X/mo
    *   Tier 2 (Co-Pilot): $2X/mo
    *   Tier 3 (Auto-Pilot): $5X/mo
    *   Let them upgrade as they trust it. Don't make me calculate efficiency percentages.

### C. The "Network Effect" objection
*   *Concern*: Prospects ask "Why should I train your AI for free?"
*   *Pitch*: We need a rebuttal script. Something like "You aren't training it for free; you are accessing the training from 500 other companies for free. It's a trade."

## 3. Verdict
**green_light**: This product sets us apart. The "Zero-Shot Onboarding" is the spear tip. Simplify the pricing and give me a sexy demo UI for the `ArchitectAgent`, and we will crush the number.

## 4. The Partner Scorecard (Sales Tool v9.0)

**New Artifact**: "The Automation Readiness Scorecard"
*   **Purpose**: A standardized tool to qualify partners during onboarding.
*   **Dimensions**:
    1.  **Signal Maturity**: "Do they send consistent X12, or random CSVs?"
    2.  **Automation Readiness**: "Are they contractually ready for auto-dispatch?"
    3.  **Risk Profile**: "High value pharma? Or bulk sand?"
*   **Output**: Recommended `Autonomy Ceiling` (e.g., "Start this partner at Level 2").

**Narrative**: "Autonomy is a journey. We start you at Level 2 (Co-Pilot) and verify trust. Once you hit 99% accuracy, we unlock Level 4 (Auto-Pilot)."
