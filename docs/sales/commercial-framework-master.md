# Commercial Framework Master: Sales-Led Autonomy

**Purpose**: Build revenue fast while converging toward industry-standard autonomous platform  
**Version**: 9.0 (Sales-Aligned)  
**Status**: 🔒 **CANONICAL** - All pricing/autonomy decisions reference this

---

## 1. Core Strategy (Executive Summary)

- Start **sales-first**, not platform-first
- Monetize **assisted autonomy early**
- Let autonomy mature **per intent**, not per customer
- Protect long-term dominance by freezing the core only at maturity

**Version Path**:
- **v6.0** (Q1 2026) — Sales-Led Autonomy (L1-L2, Revenue engine)
- **v7.0** (Q2 2026) — Conditional Autonomy (L3, Trust & proof)
- **v8.0** (H2 2026) — Platform Gravity (L4, Ecosystem dominance)
- **v9.0** (2027+) — Industry Standard (L5, Constitutional core)

---

## 2. The Paid Autonomy Ladder

Autonomy is earned and paid for progressively.

### 🟩 Level 1 — Visibility Automation (10–15%)

**Tagline**: "Show me what's happening."  
**What we automate**:
- Observe, normalize, detect
- No system writes
- Zero operational risk

**What customer feels**: Less chaos, faster answers  
**Why they pay**: Immediate time savings, zero risk  
**Pricing**: $500/month (1.0× baseline)

---

### 🟨 Level 2 — Assisted Execution (25–35%)

**Tagline**: "Do it for me — but let me approve."  
**What we automate**:
- AI proposes, humans approve
- Reversible actions
- Direct labor savings

**What customer feels**: Relief, fewer fires  
**Why they pay more**: Measurable labor reduction  
**Pricing**: $1,000-$2,000/month (2.0× multiplier)

---

### 🟦 Level 3 — Conditional Autonomy (50–60%)

**Tagline**: "Handle it — unless something unusual happens."  
**What we automate**:
- Auto-execute within confidence thresholds
- Humans handle anomalies only
- Real headcount reduction

**What customer feels**: Operations running quietly  
**Why they upgrade**: True headcount savings  
**Pricing**: $2,000-$5,000/month (4.0× multiplier)

---

### 🟪 Level 4 — Cross-Domain Autonomy (70–80%)

**Tagline**: "Optimize the system, not just tasks."  
**What we automate**:
- Multi-agent optimization across finance, ops, carriers
- Policy-driven tradeoffs
- Structural margin improvement

**What customer feels**: Competitive advantage  
**Why they pay significantly more**: Structural efficiency  
**Pricing**: $7,000-$15,000/month (7.0× multiplier)

---

### 🟥 Level 5 — Full Autonomous Operations (90%+)

**Tagline**: "Operate my logistics business."  
**What we automate**:
- Humans define intent, system operates end-to-end
- Governance-only intervention
- Platform becomes infrastructure

**What customer feels**: Logistics invisible, cost predictable  
**Why they pay the most**: This is infrastructure  
**Pricing**: $15,000-$50,000+/month (12.0× multiplier, strategic tier)

---

## 3. Technical Contract per Autonomy Tier

Each tier upgrades **four contracts**:

### 1️⃣ Decision Authority Contract (who decides)
### 2️⃣ Execution Rights Contract (what runs automatically)
### 3️⃣ Risk & Override Contract (rollback, kill switch, escalation)
### 4️⃣ Audit & Liability Contract (traceability and accountability)

**Constitutional Rule**: Autonomy never increases without stronger audit guarantees.

See: [38_TECHNICAL_CONTRACTS_BY_TIER.md](TECHNICAL_CONTRACTS_BY_TIER.md) for full specs.

---

## 4. Intent × Autonomy Model (Revolutionary)

**Key Insight**: Autonomy is evaluated **per intent**, not per customer.

### Why This Matters

Different intents mature at different speeds:

| Intent | Typical Path | Timeline |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Invoice Processing | Fast path (L1→L3 in 60 days) | Safe, high volume |
| Load Planning | Medium path (L1→L3 in 90 days) | Moderate risk |
| Claims & Disputes | Slow path (L1→L2 only) | High risk, capped |

**Commercial Advantage**: Continuous expansion revenue as each intent unlocks higher tiers.

### Example Customer Journey

**Month 1**: L1 on all intents ($500/mo)  
**Month 2**: L2 on Invoice Processing ($1,000/mo)  
**Month 3**: L3 on Invoice, L2 on Load Planning ($2,500/mo)  
**Month 6**: L3 on Load Planning, L2 on Claims ($3,500/mo)

**Result**: Natural MRR expansion without forced upgrades.

---

## 5. Pricing Autonomy per Intent

### Pricing Formula

```
Monthly Price = Platform Base + Σ(Intent Price)

Intent Price = Volume Metric × Autonomy Multiplier
```

### Autonomy Multipliers (Revised for Value Capture)

| Level | Multiplier | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **L1** | 1.0× | Baseline visibility |
| **L2** | 2.0× | 50% labor savings → 2× fair |
| **L3** | 4.0× | Headcount reduction → 4× justified |
| **L4** | 7.0× | Structural advantage → premium |
| **L5** | 12.0× | Infrastructure play → strategic tier |

**Platform Base**: $200-$500/month (governance, audit, dashboards)

### Example Pricing

**Small Broker** (1,000 transactions/month):
- L1: $500/mo
- L2: $1,000/mo
- L3: $2,000/mo

**Mid-Size 3PL** (5,000 transactions/month):
- L1: $1,000/mo
- L2: $2,000/mo
- L3: $5,000/mo
- L4: $10,000/mo

**Enterprise** (20,000+ transactions/month):
- Starts at $15,000/mo
- Custom L5 contracts

## 6. Customer Classes & Economics

### Class A — Founding Design Partners (FDPs)

**Criteria**: First 10 customers, strategic value  
**What they get**:
- ✅ Price lock (3-year guarantee at v6.0 rates)
- ✅ Faster autonomy progression (50% fewer evidence samples)
- ✅ Design council influence (quarterly strategy input)
- ✅ Exit protections (90-day data export, no lock-in)

**What they DON'T get**:
- ❌ Permanent discounts (price lock expires after 3 years)
- ❌ Custom forks (everyone on same codebase)
- ❌ Unlimited support (standard SLA applies)

**FDP Pricing**: Standard rates with 3-year lock + Autonomy Credits

### Class B — Growth Customers

**Criteria**: Customers 11-100  
**What they get**:
- ✅ Public pricing (transparent, fair)
- ✅ Standard autonomy timelines
- ✅ SLAs and repeatable onboarding

**Pricing**: Full public rates, no locks

### Class C — Industry Standard Customers

**Criteria**: Post-100, mature market  
**What they get**:
- ✅ Highest reliability (99call.9% SLA)
- ✅ Long-term support (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Premium features first

**Pricing**: Premium rates (1.2× standard), no negotiation

---

## 7. Autonomy Credit System (Instead of Discounts)

**Problem**: Price discounts erode long-term value  
**Solution**: Non-monetary credits that unlock value faster

### Credit Types

#### Evidence Credits
**What**: Fewer data samples needed to level up  
**Example**: FDPs need 30 days L2 performance (vs 90 days standard)  
**Earn by**: Early adoption, clean data, partnership

#### Authority Credits
**What**: Higher auto-execution caps  
**Example**: L3 customer gets L4 confidence threshold (95% vs 90%)  
**Earn by**: Consistent performance, executive sponsorship

#### Velocity Credits
**What**: Priority enablement and reviews  
**Example**: 1-week autonomy review (vs 2-week standard)  
**Earn by**: Strategic partnership, referrals

### Credit Expiration
- Evidence Credits: 12-month validity
- Authority Credits: Tied to performance (revoked if dips)
- Velocity Credits: Per-upgrade basis

**Result**: Customers chase credits, not discounts. Pricing integrity maintained.

**Requirements**:
- ✅ 30 days clean L1 history
- ✅ 95% data quality score
- ✅ 1 human approval workflow tested

**Timeline**: 12-24 months  
**Availability**: Strategic customers only (limited slots)

---

## 9. Downgrade & Exit Policies

### Downgrade Rules (Autonomy Ratchet)

**Philosophy**: Once data addiction sets in, downgrade is discouraged

**Rules**:
- ❌ L3+ cannot downgrade to L1 (data lock-in, migration painful)
- ✅ Pause allowed (freeze at current level, maintain pricing)
- ⚠️ L3→L2 downgrade = 90-day manual migration (we assist but don't encourage)

**Why**: By L3, operations depend on autonomy. Downgrade breaks workflows.

### Exit Protections (FDPs Only)

**FDP Guarantee**:
- ✅ 90-day data export window (full Intent graph, audit logs)
- ✅ Intent schema portability (no proprietary lock-in)
- ✅ Migration support (we help, don't block)

**Standard Customers**:
- 30-day export window
- Self-service migration
- Standard support rates apply

**Philosophy**: We want customers to stay because we're great, not because we trapped them.

## 12. Founder Rules (Non-Negotiable)

🔒 **Rule 1**: Sell outcomes, not autonomy  
_Never say "we're autonomous". Always say "we save you X hours/dollars"._

🔒 **Rule 2**: Autonomy matures at the speed of trust  
_Never force upgrades. Let evidence speak._

🔒 **Rule 3**: Never discount the future standard  
_Credits yes, discounts no. Protect long-term value._

🔒 **Rule 4**: Increase decision authority only with stronger audit  
_Every autonomy upgrade = audit contract upgrade. No exceptions._

🔒 **Rule 5**: Intent × Autonomy = Infinite Expansion  
_Each intent unlocks new revenue. This is the moat._

### Objection Handling: "Price is too high"

**Customer**: "L3 pricing doubles. That's steep."

**Response**:
> "Fair question. Let's look at ROI:
>  
> At L2, you approve 100 invoices/day manually (15 min each = 25 hours/week).
> 
> At L3, we handle 95 automatically. You review 5 exceptions (1 hour/week).
> 
> Labor savings: 24 hours/week × $50/hour = $1,200/week = $4,800/month.
> 
> Your cost goes from $2,000 → $4,000 (+$2,000).
> Your savings go from $0 → $4,800.
> 
> Net gain: $2,800/month.
> 
> The real question: Can you afford NOT to upgrade?"
