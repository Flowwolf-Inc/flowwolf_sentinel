## 💰 The Paid Autonomy Ladder

**Core Insight**: Autonomy is per-intent, not per-customer

| Level | Autonomy | Price Range | Multiplier | Timeline |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **🟩 L1: Visibility** | 10-15% | $500/mo | 1.0× | v9.1 |
| **🟨 L2: Assisted** | 25-35% | $1K-$2K/mo | 2.0× | v9.1 |
| **🟦 L3: Conditional** | 50-60% | $2K-$5K/mo | 4.0× | v9.1 |
| **🟪 L4: Cross-Domain** | 70-80% | $7K-$15K/mo | 7.0× | v9.1 |
| **🟥 L5: Full Autonomous** | 90%+ | $15K-$50K+/mo | 12.0× | v9.1 |

**Formula**: `Monthly Price = Platform Base + Σ(Intent Price × Autonomy Multiplier)`

See: [../sales/commercial-framework.md](../sales/commercial-framework.md)

## 🎯 Strategic Intent

> **Revenue now → Industry dominance later**

### Execution Philosophy
- Start **sales-first**, not platform-first
- Monetize **assisted autonomy early** (L1-L2 in v9.1)
- Let autonomy mature **per intent** (Invoice faster than Claims)
- Protect long-term by **freezing core only at maturity** (v9.1)

## 🔥 Immediate Next Steps (Jan 12, 2026, 9:14 AM PST)

### Week 1 Goal: The Demo That Sells
**Deliverable**: 30-minute live demo
- EDI 204 → Intent extraction
- Autonomy Ladder visualization
- Per-intent pricing calculator
- ROI: $2/transaction → $0.10/transaction

**Sales Pitch**: "Replace your EDI team with Flowwolf Sentinel"

### Week 4 Goal: First Pilot (FDP)
- 1 Founding Design Partner signed
- 10 loads processed at L1
- Upgrade path to L2 demonstrated

### Week 11 Goal: Revenue
- $10K MRR minimum (5 customers @ $2K avg)
- 1 case study published
- 5 qualified leads in pipeline

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

### Intent × Autonomy Model (Revolutionary)
**Old Way**: Customer at "Level 2" across all workflows  
**Our Way**: Invoice Processing at L3, Load Planning at L2, Claims at L1

**Why This Wins**:
- Faster monetization (safe intents upgrade quick)
- Continuous expansion (each intent = new revenue)
- Natural upsell ("Want Load Planning at L3?")

### Autonomy Credit System (Not Discounts)
Instead of price discounts, we give:
- **Evidence Credits**: Faster upgrade timelines
- **Authority Credits**: Higher execution caps
- **Velocity Credits**: Priority enablement

**Why This Wins**: Maintains pricing integrity, gamifies growth

### FDP Framework (Strategic Partnerships)
- **First 10 customers**: 3-year price lock + credits
- **No permanent discounts**: Locks expire
- **Exit protections**: 90-day data export, no trap

**Why This Wins**: Early trust without long-term margin erosion

## 🔒 The Three Constitutional Laws

1. **If it runs** → `fw` (execution identity)
2. **If it governs** → `flowwolf` (platform identity)
3. **If it describes** → tooling (metadata only)
