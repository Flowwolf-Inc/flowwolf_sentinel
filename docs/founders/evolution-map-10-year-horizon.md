# 10-Year Evolution Map: The Road to the Operating System Layer

**Version**: 9.3 (Agentic Core)
**Context**: Long-term strategic roadmap for Antigravity Flowwolf.

## Phase 1: Cognitive EDI (Now – 2 Years)
**"Better Integration"**
*   **Focus**: AI-Assisted EDI with Explainability.
*   **Key Tech**: Agents (Parser/Validator/Mapper), Entity Resolution.
*   **Value**: Drastic reduction in setup time and manual error correction.
*   **Autonomy**: Level 3 (Conditional).

## Phase 2: Protocol-Agnostic Operations (2 – 4 Years)
**"Universal Translation"**
*   **Focus**: EDI, APIs, Email, and PDF Portals treated equally.
*   **Key Tech**: The **Intent Graph**. Normalizing all signals into "Intent".
*   **Value**: "Send us data however you want."
*   **Autonomy**: Level 4 (High).

## Phase 3: Predictive & Proactive Ops (4 – 6 Years)
**"The Psychic Supply Chain"**
*   **Focus**: Inferring missing intents.
*   **Example**: "Partner X usually sends a 214 by now. They haven't. System auto-generates a status inquiry."
*   **Key Tech**: Predictive Anomaly Agents, Network-wide Pattern Recognition.
*   **Autonomy**: Level 4+.

## Phase 4: Agent-to-Agent Coordination (6 – 8 Years)
**"The Negotiation Layer"**
*   **Focus**: Autonomous negotiation under policy.
*   **Example**: "Truck broke down. My Agent talks to Carrier's Agent to re-negotiate delivery window within approved 2-hour slack."
*   **Key Tech**: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Governance Contracts.
*   **Autonomy**: Level 5 (Trust-Boundary constrained).

## Phase 5: Autonomous Operating System Layer (8 – 10 Years)
**"The Invisible Infrastructure"**
*   **Focus**: Flowwolf disappears. It becomes the invisible reliable mesh governing global logistics.
*   **Key Tech**: Decentralized Identity, Smart Contracts (Blockchain?).
*   **Value**: Zero-friction global commerce.

**Strategic Imperative**:
We are building the foundation for Phase 5 today by architecting for **Intent** and **Governance**, not just "Parsing X12".

## Phase 6: The Autonomous Fleet Integration (Years 8-10)

**"The Digital Driver"**
*   **Focus**: Native integration with AV Fleets (Waymo Via, Aurora, TuSimple).
*   **Key Tech**: **Transfer Hub Logic**.
    *   The system treats an AV not just as a "Truck" but as a "Non-Sleeping Asset".
    *   Dynamic re-routing for "Transfer Hubs" (Exit-to-Exit logic).
*   **Value**: Flowwolf becomes the "Brain" that hands off the baton between Human and Robot drivers.
