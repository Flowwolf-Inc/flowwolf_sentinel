## 🚫 What We DON'T Build (v6.0)

To ship fast, we defer:

❌ Multi-language support (English only)  
❌ Mobile app (web only)  
❌ Voice input (EDI/Email only)  
❌ Advanced reporting (basic metrics only)  
❌ Custom workflows (standard flow only)  
❌ White-labeling (Flowwolf brand only)  

**Rationale**: Revenue first, features later

---

## 🎯 The North Star

**v6.0 Vision**: "Flowwolf Autonomous replaces your EDI team"  
**v7.0 Vision**: "Flowwolf Autonomous is how modern brokers operate"  
**v8.0 Vision**: "Flowwolf Autonomous is the logistics operating system"  
**v9.0 Vision**: "Flowwolf Autonomous IS the logistics industry standard"

---

## ✅ Alignment with Technical v9.0

**Technical v9.0** (the docs we just completed) = The destination  
**Sales v6.0** (this plan) = The path to get there

**Bridge**:
- Technical docs = "What we'll become"
- Sales plan = "How we get revenue to fund it"
- Both true, different timelines

---

**Start**: Monday, Jan 12, 2026, 9:14 AM PST  
**First Milestone**: Demo ready by Jan 26  
**First Revenue**: By March 31  
**Industry Standard**: By 2027

**Let's build.** 🚀
