# Flowwolf Sentinel: The Intent-Native Operating System

> **"Just as Linux became the OS for servers, Flowwolf is the OS for logistics coordination."**

Flowwolf Sentinel is an AI-Native coordination layer built on Frappe. It extracts business **Intent** from any signal (EDI, Email, API) and executes it via governed **Autonomous Agents**, progressing safely through trust-based **Autonomy Tiers**.

## 🏗️ The 3-App Triad

Flowwolf is architected into three distinct layers to ensure isolation and scalability:

1.  **`fw_cortex` (Cognition)**: Governance, Entity Resolution, and Intent Graph.
2.  **`fw_fluent` (Perception)**: Multi-protocol ingestion (EDI, Email, API).
3.  **`fw_motion` (Execution)**: Operational reality and business transactions.
